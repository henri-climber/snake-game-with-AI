# snake-game-with-AI
Play by yourself or let the AI play for you. One AI with the Hamiltonian-Path and one with Breadth-First-Search

# Gamemodes
main.py --> if you want to play by yourself
main_ai_hamiltonian_path.py --> the snake will always win but it is really slow
main_ai_shortest_path.py --> the snake takes the shortest path to the next apple and is therefore a lot faster but will most likeley die before filling up the whole field

# Setup
You need to have python and pygame installed in order to play the game.
Follow the instructions on this site: https://pypi.org/project/pygame/
